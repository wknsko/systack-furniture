        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <div class="text">It began 20 years ago, in a small corner space – yes, it was a garage – where our
            interpretation of Canadian Modern came to life. Since then, we have grown, relocated, broadened and refined
            our tastes, but our ethos has remained the same. We design, build and sell modern furniture that is
            functional and timeless. Our flagship line of Originals is designed in-house and made to order in Canada,
            supporting craftspeople in our communities and featuring locally-sourced sustainable materials.

            We are also the original Gus* Modern retailer, offering their complete collection of mid-century inspired
            quick-ship modern furniture borne of a great Canadian success story. We also feature a robust selection of
            in-stock furniture, lighting and accessories from a number of suppliers both online and exclusive to our
            showroom.

            In a world where thousands of sofas are stacked miles high in million-square-foot warehouses, we keep
            everything personal with curated collections of modern furnishings, lighting, rugs and accents. We design
            with you and we build for you. We offer the personal attention and custom approach of a small
            brick-and-mortar retail store with the expansive reach, diverse catalog and competitive pricing of a big
            tech company – you know, the ones that just happen to sell furniture.

            Our two-story showroom on Ossington Avenue is packed full of inspiration. Any member of our team will be
            happy to walk you through it – or let you explore at your own pace. We've been around since 2000, and every
            day we continue to grow. Visit us to learn why.</div>
